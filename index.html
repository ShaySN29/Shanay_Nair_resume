                            <p class="mb-2"> <span id="greeting">Hello, I am Shanay!</span> I grew up in Port Elizabeth and moved to Cape Town in 2016 when I started my 
                                first job. I currently work as a Forensic Analyst for the South African Police Service as a Warrant Officer. I studied BSc Biochemistry 
                                and Chemistry and BSc Honours Chemistry at the Nelson Mandela University. I love science because of the problem solving and the ability 
                                to create useful compounds by combining different resources. I decided it was time for a career change because there was no growth for 
                                me in my current career.
                            </p>
                    
                            <p class="mb-3 p-2"> In 2022 I started a Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp with HyperionDev which I completed in January 2023 with an aggregate 
                                of 99%. I love being creative and so I decided Web Development would be a good path for me. At the end of the Bootcamp I am able to build 
                                and deploy applications using the MERN stack. I am motivated by my need to improve myself.
                            </p>

                            <p class="mb-3 p-2"> I am hardworking and enthusiastic, I am always willing to learn new skills. I am a spontaneous planner and have a good sense of 
                                humour. I am passionate about food, animals and learning about new topics. My dream is to travel more and to accomplish this career 
                                change that I have started.
